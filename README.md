# O3DE README

This is a currently a barebones extension providing limited functionality. Currently, its primary feature
is F12 navigation to files and functions within `.shader`, `.pass`, `.azsl`, `.azsli`, and `.srgi` files.

For the extension to properly locate a file, the file referenced must be available within the VS Code workspace.
